Disjoint set : It is very useful to find out the cycle in any graph.

Suppose there is a undirected graph with weighted edges..

We pick edges randomly or with some specific pattern (as per krushkal algorithm to find minimum spanning tree
always smallest weight edge is picked). We assume each selected edge is a set ans find its both verctices in all
sets exiting as pf now.
case 1: If both vertices belong to same existing set then there is a cycle, dont pick this edge.
case 2: If both vertces belong to two different existing set then merge the two existing sets by weight/rank and
        pick this edge.
        
Merging two sets by weight: If both sets parent root has same weight then any sets parent can become parent
of the other sets else higher weight/rank set's root will become parent of the other set's root.

case 3: If only one vertex exist in any of the existing sets then, merge(union) the existing set with selected edge set.
case 4: If both vertices dont exist in any of the exiting set then, dont perform merging(union) and keep the set
represented by picking edge as seperate.

For understanding, we can draw each set as a tree and perform merging(union)

Array representation is the best way to represent the same. Initially each node will be parent of self and it will reprsent a tree of one node so, each index will have -1.

For detailed explanation, please look into Abdul Bari Channel on you tube.

Krushkal Algorithm of minimum spaning tree is based on this algorithm.
