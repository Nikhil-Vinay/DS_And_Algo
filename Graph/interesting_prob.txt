1. There are N planets, each planet have different subset  of currencies - c1, c2, c3...CN.
   Two planets can trade with each other if they have atleast one common currency. planet1 can trade with planet
   3 if both planets have atleast one intermediate planet which will fill the gap...
   Find out minimum new number of currency to be introduced so all planets can trade with each other.

   Solution - Find out number of forest. Then answer is number of forest - 1.
              It can be solved by BFS or DFS.

2. If there are N building and some set of connection between these buildings. If building x catches fire then
   how soon building Y will get the fire. Time to traverse one building to another is constant called 't'.

   Solution: - It is beautiful example of BFS.

3. BFS is very useful in finding shortest path and DFS is popular in finding any loop.

4. Finding number of forest(disconnected graphs), both BFS and DFS can be used.

5. http pages have some implementation as graph( every button - home, previous, next etc are nodes and have
   a path between each other).

6. LinkedIn and Facebook have good implementation graph inside to make connections. Each member is a node and 
   connected with each other with a ranked edge. ranked edge has some weightage. Even A has direct friend B 
   and C but edge rank can be different and edge rank is always dynamic. If A and C shares/likes/tags more posts
   on each other then edge between A and C will have higher rank than edge between A and B.

7. In networking, side routing algorithm uses graph concept. If some data need to propagate from delhi server 
   to bangalore and it has different path then it will search the shortest routing path to reach bangalore.
