Graph coloring problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.

Vertex coloring is the most common graph coloring problem. The problem is, given m colors, find a way of coloring
the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are colored using same color. The other graph coloring
problems like Edge Coloring (No vertex is incident to two edges of same color) and Face Coloring (Geographical 
Map Coloring) can be transformed into vertex coloring.

Chromatic Number: The smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G so that no two adjascent vertex will
have same color, is called its chromatic number. 

Application Of Graph Coloring:
=============================
1) Making Schedule or Time Table: 
=================================
Suppose we want to make am exam schedule for a university. We have list different subjects and students enrolled
in every subject. Many subjects would have common students (of same batch, some backlog students, etc). How do we
schedule the exam so that no two exams with a common student are scheduled at same time? How many minimum time 
slots are needed to schedule all exams? This problem can be represented as a graph where every vertex is a 
subject and an edge between two vertices mean there is a common student. So this is a graph coloring problem 
where minimum number of time slots is equal to the chromatic number of the graph.

2) Mobile Radio Frequency Assignment: 
=====================================
When frequencies are assigned to towers, frequencies assigned to all towers at the same location must be 
different. How to assign frequencies with this constraint? What is the minimum number of frequencies needed? 
This problem is also an instance of graph coloring problem where every tower represents a vertex and an edge 
between two towers represents that they are in range of each other.

3) Sudoku: 
==========
Sudoku is also a variation of Graph coloring problem where every cell represents a vertex. There is an edge 
between two vertices if they are in same row or same column or same block.

4) Register Allocation: 
=======================
In compiler optimization, register allocation is the process of assigning a large number of target program 
variables onto a small number of CPU registers. This problem is also a graph coloring problem.

Note: Usually backtracking is used in graph colouring, suppose there k colors then we color a vertex with 1st 
color then call on rest of the vertexes with (k-1) color. Look into solutions.
