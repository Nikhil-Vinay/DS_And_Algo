/* There sre two given arrays A and B which has list of integers. Integers of A can be connected with same integers
 * in B only. We need to find maximum number of lines made by similar integers in both the arrays. Lines should not
 * intersect to each other.
 *
 * Example:
 * A = [ 1, 2, 4 ]
 * B = [ 1, 4, 2, 5 ]
 *
 * max number of lines = 2  [1--1, 2--2] or [1--1, 4--4]
 */

/* Solution: We need to fing longest common subsequence between two arrays */
